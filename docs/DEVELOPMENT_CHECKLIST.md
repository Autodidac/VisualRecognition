# Development Checklist

Use this checklist for every change to keep the project consistent and releasable.

- [ ] Review `VERSION` and bump it when behavior or UI changes in a user-visible way.
- [ ] Update `README.md` and relevant docs to describe new capabilities or workflows.
- [ ] Keep `docs/CONTRIBUTOR_QUICKSTART.md` accurate when runtime flows or file locations change.
- [ ] Run local builds in Visual Studio (Debug/Release) and verify the app launches.
- [ ] Manually exercise the capture, classify, and learn flows to ensure hooks and persistence still work.
- [ ] Regenerate or update any example model artifacts if training formats change.
- [ ] Add notes to `docs/ROADMAP.md` if you introduce new follow-up tasks.
- [ ] Commit with a clear summary and create a PR describing the changes and validation.
